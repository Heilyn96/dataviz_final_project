The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find my analisis about US Births in U.S for the years 2000 to 2014. This dataset has 5,479 observations and the data is presented by six variables that are year, month, date of month, day of week of week and the number of births. In this folder you can find the plots that I made for this dataset.  

Below is an scatterplot that shows how the number of births in the U.S tends to decrease after the year 2007. So, what was happening in the U.S after year 2007 ? Why the number of births decreased in a notable way? Well, the economic recession is the answer because economic conditions tend to affect fertility. The economic crisis that stared in U.S between 2007 and 2008 produce that number of births fell abruptly.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the number of bad drivers in U.S involved in fatal collisions. I pretend to visualize which State has the worst drivers in the country and if the number of accidents where drivers who were not distracted is considerable. If you are interested to know what are the major contributed factor in fatal accidents, you should take a look of my analysis. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

Below is a visualization of what you can find in the folder:
